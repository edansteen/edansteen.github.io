This website is my personal project portfolio and showcases both my technical experience as well as some of projects I've made. This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

Feel free to browse around and see how I built the site!
