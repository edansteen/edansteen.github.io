This website is my personal project portfolio and showcases the projects I wanted to highlight.

Feel free to browse around and see how I built the site.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
