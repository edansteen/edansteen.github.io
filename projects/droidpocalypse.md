Droidpocalypse is a robot survival game created for a high school capstone project using Godot v3.5.1. The game is heavily inspired by the Roguelike Indie game Vampire Survivors created by poncle, and thus has similar gameplay. 

I programmed the game using Godot's GDScript (based on Python), and had a lot of fun solving all the unique challenges it presented, from figuring out how to create all the unique weapons to the creative challenge of coming up with unique enemy characters.

There are so many challenges to game development that most people never realize — the countless number of hours I spent perfecting pixel art, solving tiny little glitches, and ensuring the gameplay felt smooth will probably never be noticed by 95% of players, but I learned that every single detail counts in game development and it's the little things you'll never immediately notice that make a game great. This project gave me a newfound appreciation for the technical and creative feat that creating a game is, and I've only enjoyed other games more since.
