For CPEN 211, I designed a digital combination lock in SystemVerilog for the DE1-SoC FPGA board. I also created a custom test bench to verify the functionality of the code before uploading it to the board. You can look in more detail on the GitHub page, which also includes a logic diagram describing the complete system.
