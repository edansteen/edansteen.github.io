Currently, a lot of my free time goes into this project.

The purpose of the project is to build a plant withing a 1-foot by 1-foot by 1-foot cube that performs direct air capture (DAC). For this competition we must also present our design in front of a panel of judges (twice), create a technical poster detailing our design, produce a 1-minute video advertisement, and design a custom logo. 

As a co-founder of this team and a leading member, my role is to plan the project with our 2 co-leads, lead the administration and marketing teams, ensure that our 15 members are on track to meet the competition deadlines, ensure that our team will qualify, help with training members, and assist in the design when needed (primarily the electrical/electronics components). 

Before we qulaify for the main competition in Minneapolis, MN, hosted at the AIChE Student Conference, we have to complete our design and record a video to present it in early April. Right now the team's focus is solidifying our design and producing it in CAD using OnShape.

It's been a lot of work, but I've been having a blast seeing this project come to fruition over the past couple of weeks and seeing how much the team has grown from pretty much nothing. I'm really excited to see it come together and am confident our team has what it takes to excel in this competition!

Our team is currently updating our website and working on the marketing strategy for this new team, so stay tuned and follow the team on Instagram @ubcbiot!
