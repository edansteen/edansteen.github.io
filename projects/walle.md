For an event called Ball Model, my friends and I built a remote controlled WALL-E replica that automatically pours out a drink!

It uses a PS4 Controller connected wirelessly to an ESP32 to control 2 hoverboard motors and move around. A separate system based on an Arduino UNO handles the drink dispensing using an ultrasonic distance sensor and colour sensor to detect red solo cups, as well as a 12V DC pump to pour out an ounce of liquid and an LCD display to indicate the status of the pour.

The project took a big mix of programming in C, CAD modelling in OnShape, and a lot of teamwork to get the project done in our timeframe while keeping up with our studies. The majority of the assembly was done within 24 hours of our deadline, and we were extremely proud we were able to finish it in time!
