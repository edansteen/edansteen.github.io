This project is for ELEC 391, where me my 5 team members were tasked to build a robot that can autonomously play a song on a digital keyboard. As the project is still in progress, we don't want to reveal too much in case things change, but the project will be completed by April 2026.

Currently my tasks include:
- Producing simulation in MATLAB Simulink to design a PID controller and predict system functionality.
- Writing firmware for STM32H753ZI microcontroller in C with STM32CubeIDE and STM32CubeMX to handle timing, key presses, and logic.
- Implementing FreeRTOS for task scheduling.
