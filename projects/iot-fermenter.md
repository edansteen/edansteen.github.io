The IoT Fermenter is a project I planned, organized, and lead at UBC Biological Internet of Things.

The plan is to retrofit a fermenter with various sensors to allow us to collect data on our fermentations for analysis and training machine learning models in the future, as well as monitor conditions to prevent failures or contamination before they cause damage.

Some features include:
- pH, temperature, DO, and pressure sensors
- Spout for sampling/serving
- Display for showing sensor data
- Sensor data sent to mini PC over WiFi via MQTT
- Server-side Python script to save and organize data from the MQTT broker
- Web application to plot, save, and analyze data
- Discord bot to send alerts to team members
