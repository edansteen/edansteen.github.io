In my final year of highschool I built this Snake game using pure Java and its Swing library. 

The entire project took me only a handful of hours, which showcases both my problem solving ability and the proficiency I had with Java at the time. I got a lot of practice integrating classes effectively in Object-Oriented Programming, and of course had a lot of fun testing the final game and learning how to implement it. I received a score of 95% for the project, so needless to say it turned out pretty well!
