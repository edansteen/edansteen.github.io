In my senior year of highschool I built this Snake game using pure Java and its Swing library. 

The entire project took me less than a week and a handful of hours in a pre-ChatGPT era, which showcases my problem solving ability and the proficiency I had with Java at the time. Unfortunately I haven't touched Java since, but I've still got the same problem-solving ability, which is more important anyway.
