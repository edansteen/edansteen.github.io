When I say this section is "miscellaneous" I really do mean miscellaneous. Learning to ride a motorcycle has nothing to do with engineering per se, but I just wanted to share the things I've been up to. 

One could argue it shows my courage, ability to think on my feet, and my capability of quickly making difficult decisions that prioritize safety. Or it just shows I'm cool. Hopefully all of the above.
