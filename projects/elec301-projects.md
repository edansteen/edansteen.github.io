For ELEC 301 Electronic Circuits, our "Mini Projects" (that each took 20-30 hours) were specialized questions designed to apply the knowledge we gained throughout the course in circuit analysis to design various filters and oscillators. We used LTSpice to model the circuits and verify our designs, as well as to compare our simplified models that were used for hand calculations to the values that we would actually expect to see to verify accuracy.
