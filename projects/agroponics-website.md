UBC Agroponics is a student-led engineering design team where our goal is to create a fully automated hydroponic farm on campus. Currently, my role on the team is being the web developer. I built the site completely from scratch, using the Next.js framework (just like this portfolio!).

While web development isn't the route I intend to go with as a long-term career, the project had definitely improved my problem-solving and coding skills. Figuring out how to convert markdown files into actual pages with very outdated sources was a difficult challenge, but in the end the solution worked so well that I reused it for this site too.

Web development also serves as an essential skill with the constantly-growing dependency we have on the internet as a source of information, and I have no doubt I will be writing code in JavaScript even for embedded applications in the future.
